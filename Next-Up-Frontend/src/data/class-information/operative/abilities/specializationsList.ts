			"At 11th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize any number of creatures within 60 feet, though you take a cumulative -1 penalty to your Intimidate check for every two creatures you attempt to demoralize in this way (rounded down). Then choose a number of creatures you successfully demoralized (up to a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier). Those creatures follow a single command you issue for 1 round, per command (Will negates). Once you've targeted a creature with commanding presence, it's immune to your commanding presence for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, sense-dependent fear effect; the secondary command effect is also language-dependent.",
